# 312ProjectPt2 
A repository for the CSE312 class at the University at Buffalo, for Part 2 of our project.

This is a readme file, pending updates. This readme will describe how to load the server in.

## Getting started

run "docker-compose up --build --force-recreate" in the command prompt. This will start the server and the database.

Most of the frontend is directly taken from the HW2 frontend, for now.

Objective 1 is implemented with the flask framework and mongoDB.
